                                        In simple terms, it is the ‘science of life’. It takes
                                        into account the physical and mental states of a person
                                        and gives a holistic approach to health. This traditional
                                        system of medicine has been time tested for tens of
                                        thousands of years and holds good till the current era. It
                                        is a natural way of healing the body using different
                                        combinations of herbs, animal products and purified metals
                                        reduced to nano particles.

                                        becoming popular.

                                        SDM medicines are formulated keeping multiple factors in
                                        mind. The age and the health status of the person, the
                                        state of the person’s digestion capacity, absorption and
                                        the mode of dosage, all determine the combination of
                                        medicines that go into a formulation and its dosage form.
                                        From simple process of making churna kalpas (powders) to
                                        medicinal preparations that can take weeks and months to
                                        ferment and complete like the arista; the ones that are
                                        prepared by cold infusions to the bhasmas (metallic nano

                                        centigrade. The traditional medicines have unique recipes
